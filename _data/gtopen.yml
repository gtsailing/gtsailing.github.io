    text: "We will be hosting our fundraising regatta on April 20th, 2024. All sailors are invited to join us for a fun day of dinghy sailing. \\

      \\

This regatta will have 5 fleets: two 420 fleets â€“ one for the ACA 8th-12th grade sailors and one for all other 420 sailors, a laser fleet, an Opti fleet for junior sailors, and a Portsmouth fleet for all other dinghies interested in participating. Boat charter is available for 420s and lasers and is included with regatta registration. Charter will be assigned on a first come first serve basis (we have twelve 420s and three lasers available for use). \\

      \\

Registration is $60 per sailor and $40 for Optis and ACA sailors. A GT Open t-shirt and dinner is included with the registration fee. There will also be additional merchandise and dinners ($15 a person) available for purchase the day of the regatta or in the registration form. \\
