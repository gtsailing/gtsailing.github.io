      year: "1961 -- 1969"
      desc: "The Georgia Tech Sailing Club was founded in 1961 by a group of students who were united by their love of sailing. Together, they sought to bring sailing to the Georgia Tech community at large.

Lake Lanier (pictured right) was chosen as the primary location for the club’s activities off campus.

In the September of 1964, the club hosted its first regatta. Thistles were borrowed from the Lake Lanier Sailing Club to put the event on, and Georgia Tech took third place overall."

Later, during the 1980s, the club purchased a fleet of Condor 15s, a Hobie 16, and an ex-Marine Patrol powerboat."
