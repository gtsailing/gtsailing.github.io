As a Competitive Sport Club at Georgia Tech, we participate in multiple levels of sailing for competition both locally and across the southeast against other collegiate teams and also at keelboat regattas hosted by local sailing clubs. 

Undergraduates are able to be a part of the Dinghy Race Team which competes in the Inter-collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA) against other club and varsity collegiate teams. Our Keelboat Race Team is open to any club member and competes at many events hosted at LLSC and neighboring sailing clubs as well as intercollegiate keelboat regattas. For a full list of our competitive events, see the club calendar below!

**Dinghy Race Team**

The Dinghy Race Team is a student-run competitive team which regularly travels and competes against other schools in the southeast.  We are part of ICSA’s South Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association (or SAISA) conference which has fall and spring seasons. The student-athletes maintain a regular practice schedule each week as well as meeting for workouts and chalk-talks. The team sends members to regattas nearly every weekend during the semester while handling the challenging academic load of Georgia Tech. 

We field both a co-ed and women’s team which compete using both [C420s](https://club420.org/) and [Flying-Junior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_FJ) dinghies while training on our 420 fleet at LLSC.

_About College Sailing_

The Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA) is the governing authority for sailing competition at colleges and universities throughout the United States and in some parts of Canada. There are seven Conferences that schedule and administer regattas within their established geographic regions.

College sailing began on an informal, club basis in the 1890′s, and organized racing started in 1928. It has grown to include more than 230 active colleges, and racing now occurs on every weekend during fall and spring seasons and on many weekends during the winter. It is a truly coeducational sport, and it has proved itself the best incubator for the development of racing skills. Former college sailors have always numbered significantly among Olympic medalists and America’s Cup competitors.

**Keelboat Race Team**

The Keelboat Race Team is a student-run competitive team that competes at local regattas hosted at Lake Lanier and  nearby lakes as well as travels to intercollegiate regattas hosted by sailing clubs across the southeast. Any club member is able to participate and we typically have multiple practices during the semester to work on crew dynamics and team-building. 

At Lake Lanier, we typically compete using one of our J24s in the Wednesday Night Racing Series hosted by LLSC, races hosted by the Lanier Auxiliary Racing Committee  (LARC), and other seasonal regattas. Undergraduates on the team are able to compete in intercollegiate keelboat regattas such as the Southern Collegiate Offshore Regatta (SCOR) and ICSA events. At these travel events, we have sailed on a J/70 at SAISA Match Race Champs, a Colgate 26 at the Navy Keelboat Invitational, and multiple larger keelboats at SCOR.
